Project Overview
The Insurance Claim Analysis Project aims to analyze and model insurance claim data to understand risk factors and predict key outcomes such as total premiums and total claims. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, hypothesis testing, and the implementation of various machine learning models.

Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about insurance policies and claims, including various attributes related to the insured items, policyholder demographics, and the specifics of each claim.

Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insurance-claim-analysis.git
cd insurance-claim-analysis
Create and activate a virtual environment:

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Data Preparation
Steps:
Handling Missing Data: Impute or remove missing values.
Feature Engineering: Create new features relevant to TotalPremium and TotalClaims.
Encoding Categorical Data: Convert categorical data to numerical using one-hot or label encoding.
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets (80:20 ratio).
Hypothesis Testing
Hypotheses Tested:
There are no risk differences across provinces.
There are no risk differences between zip codes.
There are no significant margin (profit) differences between zip codes.
There are no significant risk differences between women and men.
Methodology:
Chi-squared tests for categorical data.
t-tests or z-tests for numerical data.
Modeling Techniques
Models Implemented:
Linear Regression: For predicting TotalPremium and TotalClaims.
Random Forest: For robust prediction and feature importance analysis.
XGBoost: For enhanced prediction performance.
Steps:
Train the models using the training dataset.
Evaluate the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results and Evaluation
Detailed evaluation of model performance.
Analysis of feature importance to understand key drivers of insurance claims and premiums.
